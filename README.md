# How it works
The following section will provide insight into how the game and its functionalities work.
## Homepage
When the page is first loaded, the user is greeted with the homepage, where he can choose the game settings or navigate to other tabs.
- Enter code: Users can enter a lobby code to join a private lobby
- Leaderboard: Displays the top 50 players in the selected categories
- About: A simple about page
- Signin/Profile: If the user is not signed in yet, the signin-form will be displayed, else this tab will show the profile page

## Playing
If the user is logged in, either as a Guest or with an account, he can choose a gamemode and begin playing. The goal is to guess the displayed words as fast as possible to earn the highest score. If the maximum time per word of 10 seconds is over, the word is automatically skipped. As soon as all players have finished, the summary page is shown where the results of all players are displayed. The retry button on the bottom right restarts the game with the same settings but new words.

## Online
When selecting online mode, an opponent, which is also searching an online game with equivalent settings, will be searched for. If an opponent exists, the game will start, else the user will be put in queue until a matching opponent is found.

## Lobby
If the user wants to set up a private game to play with his friends, he can choose create a new lobby with the specified game settings. He will then be able to share the displayed lobby code with his friends which can, after signing up, join the lobby via the enter code tab. If all players in the lobby are ready, the game will start.
